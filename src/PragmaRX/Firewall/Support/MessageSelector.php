     * Given a message with different plural translations separated by a
     * pipe (|), this method returns the correct portion of the message based
     * on the given number, locale and the pluralization rules in the message
     * itself.
     *
     * The message supports two different types of pluralization rules:
     *
     * interval: {0} There are no apples|{1} There is one apple|]1,Inf] There are %count% apples
     * indexed:  There is one apple|There are %count% apples
     *
     * The indexed solution can also contain labels (e.g. one: There is one apple).
     * This is purely for making the translations more clear - it does not
     * affect the functionality.
     *
     * The two methods can also be mixed:
     *     {0} There are no apples|one: There is one apple|more: There are %count% apples
     *
	 * @param  string $message 
	 * @param  string $number  
	 * @param  Locale $locale  
	 * @return string
